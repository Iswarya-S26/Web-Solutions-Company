- **CSS Techniques:** Incorporates advanced CSS properties and layouts such as Box Model, Flexbox, Grid, Transforms, and Transitions.
- **Optimized Styling:** Employs two external stylesheets—one specifically for media queries—and utilizes efficient CSS selectors to minimize the use of classes and IDs.
